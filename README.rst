Most psychological journals require that tables in a manuscript comply to APA (American Association of Psychology) standards. Creating APA
tables manually is often time consuming and prone to transcription errors. This package generates tables for MS Word ('.docx' extension) in APA format automatically with just a few lines of code.

I have invested a lot of time and effort in creating this R package, please cite it when using it in the preparation of a manuscript.

The package files are located in the '/src' path.
